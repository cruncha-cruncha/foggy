# FOGGY
I like to sleep in, but also like taking pictures in the fog. This repo:
- pulls content from a weather api, using golang
- builds a site to display the data, using gatsby
- pushes the static site to github pages

Cron runs the docker container everyday at noon, and I can check tomorrow morning's chance of fog.
